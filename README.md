# Advanced-Econometrics-Parametrics-and-NonParametrics-Models-2023
**Abstract**

The objective of this study is to analyze the determinants of Airbnb prices in European cities. For this we have data on ten major European cities: Amsterdam, Athens, Berlin, Budapest, Barcelona, Paris, Lisbon, London, Rome and Vienna but we choose to work on d ata relative to P aris . We have carried out descriptive statistics and correlation tests on our data to identify the variables related to our variable of interest. We also made a geographical representation of apartments in the city of Paris for certain variables (attractiv eness index, price and restaurant index). Then we estimated a linear regression model as Parametric model and compare to non parametric model that we estimated.

**Data**

To analyse the determinant s of Airbnb prices in European cities, we use a database available on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities) The databas e is entitled Airbnb prices in European cities and was provided *Gyodi* and *Nawaro* who used it to analyse the determinants of Airbnb prices using a spatial econometrics approach.

Models implemented in this project : 

 - **Parametric Models (Ordinary least squares regression)**

 - **Non Parametric Method: GAM(Generalized Additive Model)**

 - **Alternative Model : SAR(Spatial Autoregressive Models)**
